The doctrine that will guide 0th is the void.

The void is starting from nothing. It is having nothing to guide you, but nothing to constrain you either. It is not knowing the answer and not knowing how to get there.

The void is abandoning your beliefs and not (yet) replacing them. It is being bored&mdash;not in the sense of being unfulfilled by what you are going to do next, but in the sense of not knowing what to do next.

The void is the end of a relationship.

Upon entering it, one may feel lost. One may also feel liberated, as what restricted them before is gone. One may even feel hopeful&mdash;the void is a fresh start.

There are two ways to react to the void. The first is more common: this is to fill it up as quickly as possible. Those with this mindset see the void as a short, unpleasant transitional state. It may even be seen as wrong, a symbol of incapability or aimlessness if preserved for too long.

People who do this too much become stuck in their ways. They define themselves by the first path they find promising, then never wander astray. This is much of why typology and politics are defined by tribalism.

The other way to react to the void is to embrace it. This is to take many paths, never becoming too attached to one out of fear of the void. It is to think of a data point as a clue, not an anchor. It is embracing boredom until insight strikes; it is mindfulness. It is minimalism.

This mindset leads to slower results, and it can be uncomfortable. But when those results arrive, they tend to be better. And a life in which one is unafraid of the void may be fulfilling; addiction, greed, and hatred are enemies of the void. They tell you what you want, then force you to get there. When Buddhists seek contentment by avoiding desire, they may really be seeking the void.

The void, as a philosophy, is the idea that most of us are more afraid of the void than we should be. It is the idea that we should embrace the void, not rush to fill it up.

This is the philosophy that will guide my process in rebuilding what used to be Model G2. Much of socionics is overly assumptive, and those elements have been removed. It is also a philosophy I will apply to this blog and, if possible, the rest of my life.
