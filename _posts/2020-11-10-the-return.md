The typology community is toxic. This reflects the limiting, fanatical nature of some of the theory that underlies typology. This is why I left.

What I hadn't yet realized is that those aspects can simply be removed, and what remains is more valuable and more unambiguously true than any model that has preceded it.

This model is intended to solve some of the deepest problems in socionics:

* the endless disagreement and indecision concerning the types of many celebrities and members of the community
* the dogmatism and tribalistic infighting between adherents of various models
* the high barrier of entry to being typed&mdash;I have discovered tests that are truly effective
* the confirmation bias required to accept one's type with certainty
* the subjective nature of socionics, where often people use the same terminology to refer to vastly different concepts

I will be writing articles to document the development of this model. I will also be writing on other topics I explored during my hiatus, specifically in the sphere of philosophy, psychology and self-improvement.

If you want to be reminded when I release an article, you have a few options:

* subscribe to the [socionics RSS feed](/feed/socionics.xml), [non-socionics RSS feed](/feed/other.xml) or both
* join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/dyBfJvA), where you can give yourself an Article Ping role
* follow 7thcircle's [Twitter](https://twitter.com/7thcrcl)
* check back here every once in a while, I guess?
