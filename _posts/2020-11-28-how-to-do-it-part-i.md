title: How to Do It (Part I)

In [my last post](/1/), I discussed the merits of embracing the void, as opposed to filling it up as quickly as possible.

There is something more important that I did not mention; I did not discuss *how* to embrace the void. This is key because, for most people, it is impossible to simply decide to embrace the void more. The processes that lead to void-filling are often deeply ingrained habits; sometimes they are not even consciously recognizable. But by taking certain steps, we can become better.

In the spirit of the void, nothing in this post should be taken as orthodoxy. These are suggestions; they probably won't all work for you, so it is best to try each one out, then evaluate what worked for you and what didn't. I'm exploring; my wish is for you to explore with me.

# Where to Start

The methods that follow require a certain level of self-awareness. This level can be hard to attain, and most who aren't ready don't realize it—one cannot see the thoughts and beliefs one is not aware of. Those who have rejected the void are often the most confident that they have little room to improve.

Just like our attitude towards the void, awareness can be changed for the better. There are a few techniques by which one can do this; you may want to try these before proceeding onward.

## Meditation

Certain kinds of meditation are helpful for increasing awareness, including:

* mindfulness meditation (especially observing-thought)
* loving-kindness meditation
* vipassanā

The reason these are useful is unrelated to spirituality; the cognitive processes they encourage are conducive to thinking in an objective and holistic manner.

If you are able to go on a [ten-day vipassanā retreat](https://www.dhamma.org/en-US/index), your awareness will expand greatly. The spiritual aspects, of course, can be safely ignored if you wish.

If not, simply meditating every day—even for a few minutes—is far better than nothing. Guided sessions may be easier at first, and they ensure you are not doing it wrong; [Medito](https://meditofoundation.org/) offers free beginner mindfulness sessions.

If this isn't convincing, consider [the](https://psychcentral.com/blog/10-surprising-health-benefits-of-mindfulness-meditation/) [many](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2012/07-08/ce-corner) [empirically](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2018/04/harvard-researchers-study-how-mindfulness-may-change-the-brain-in-depressed-patients/) [proven](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/12-benefits-of-meditation) [benefits](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/compassion-matters/201303/benefits-mindfulness) [of](https://www.verywellmind.com/mindfulness-the-health-and-stress-relief-benefits-3145189) [mindfulness](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/meditation-in-depth) [meditation](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/consumer-health/in-depth/mindfulness-exercises/art-20046356).

## Focusing

The second most beneficial practice for increasing awareness (that I know of) is Gendlin's Focusing.

[Focusing](https://focusing.org/felt-sense/what-focusing), of course, is useful for making awareness a habit—that's not all, though. The insight it produces will help most other areas of your life in the process. Of all of the methods I enumerate in this series, Focusing will likely be the first to help you.

## Experimentation

This won't necessarily increase your self-awareness, but it will introduce you to the rewards that the void can bring.

Try doing something new. The thing doesn't have to be scary, and it can even be totally trivial; it just has to be unfamiliar. Here are some examples (try to think of some on your own, though):

* try a new hobby
* join a new community
* program with (or speak!) a different language
* take a different route when commuting
* sing, shout, or do a handstand on the wall—just to see what it feels like
* make conversation with strangers (unless you already do that)
* do something you habitually do in a different way

If you make a habit of this, you will find that sometimes your preconceptions were wrong. If this realization makes you feel uneasy, you will learn that a change in one's worldview is cause for joy, not sorrow; if it makes you feel excited, you will feel eager to experiment more in the future.
